								<h2 id="content">What is Flight Simulation...?</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><a href="images/thy.png" class="image"><img src="images/thy.png" alt="" /></a></span>Flight simulation is a technology that replicates the experience of flying an aircraft in a simulated environment. It involves the use of software and hardware to create a virtual representation of an aircraft's controls, instruments, and flight dynamics. Flight simulators range from basic software applications running on personal computers to sophisticated, full-motion simulators used for pilot training in commercial aviation.</p>

									<p>Flight simulation allows pilots to practice flying in various scenarios and conditions without the risks and costs associated with real flight. It can simulate different types of aircraft, weather conditions, airports, and flight procedures. Pilots can use simulators to train for routine flights, practice emergency procedures, and improve their skills. Flight simulation is used extensively in pilot training programs for both civilian and military aviation. It offers a safe and cost-effective way to train pilots, allowing them to gain experience and proficiency before transitioning to actual aircraft.</p>

								<h2 id="content">...and why do they need better airports?</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><a href="images/amx.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/amx.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>Most flight simulation software out of the box only comes with "default" sceneries. What this means is a lot of the global scenery and airports are made using autogenerated data from OSM (Open Street Map), and terrain maps. While this provides quantity, it does not provide quality. There are over 20,000 airport in the world and providing personalized hand-made tailored airports for each is not possible. As such members that participate in flight simulation will often times painstakingly produce their own airport sceneries in extremely high detail on their own. These can then either be provided to the community for free, or as payware.</p>

									<p>I am one of those passionate members of this community and have been making sceneries for flight simulation software since 2013 (I was 13 back then for reference). My earliest works were very rough and I have gained significant knowledge over the last 10 years, getting more than 15000 downloads on my airport sceneries, and have vastly improved my work. On this page, you will be able to check all my work and links to them, a rough outline as to what the procedure and learning curves are, and the end result of some of my best work. Hope you enjoy!</p>

									<span class="video right"><video autoplay loop muted src="images/satpath.mp4" alt="">

									<br>
									<br>
										<p> In 2019, work began on developing a CubeSat at York University that would accomplish research on climate change, solar protons, attitude control, and satellite control. Thus, Educational Space Science and ENgineering CubeSat Experiment Mission (ESSENCE) was born. Officially Nanoracks-ESSENCE, this mission set out to achieve the following goals:
											<ul>
												<li>Observe arctic ice, permafrost thaw, forests, and the Arctic region of Northern Canada using a fisheye camera.</li>
												<li>Measure energetic solar protons to better understand the impacts of solar storms on the Earth.</li>
												<li>Test a novel satellite attitude control theory to recover a satellite that has partially lost attitude control ability.</li>
												<li>Test a satellite attitude control algorithm using the "hybrid linear quadratic regulator problem," which combines magnetorquers with reaction wheels to detumble a satellite and provide greater control of the spacecraft.</li>
											</ul>
										</p>

										<p> I was honored to see that part of my contributions in the Mechanical Subsystems team led to the successful launch and operation of the satellite. The ESSENCE CubeSat Project tested my current abilities and challenged me to learn new ones. I made sure integrations of various other subsystems were sound, and if there were any integration problems, that I would work to redesign the parts to ensure the problems would be solved. I also conducted rigorous thermal analysis on the CubeSat and its parts to ensure it would survive the harsh space environment, and that all internal parts would survive when under operation. Finally, I generated technical documents, and updated the various stakeholders in the project regularly to keep them up to date with our progress in the Mechanical Subsystem. I also learned how to coordinate with multiple organizations and groups, which I thought was one of the most important lessons to take away from this project.</p>

										<p>It was also unfortunate that I could not be there in person to witness the testing phase, due to COVID-19 and other personal issues I was facing at that time, but I'm proud nonetheless that the satellite successfully made it to space.</p>
