								<h2 id="content">What is Flight Simulation...?</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><a href="images/thy.png" class="image"><img src="images/thy.png" alt="" /></a></span>Flight simulation is a technology that replicates the experience of flying an aircraft in a simulated environment. It involves the use of software and hardware to create a virtual representation of an aircraft's controls, instruments, and flight dynamics. Flight simulators range from basic software applications running on personal computers to sophisticated, full-motion simulators used for pilot training in commercial aviation.</p>

									<p>Flight simulation allows pilots to practice flying in various scenarios and conditions without the risks and costs associated with real flight. It can simulate different types of aircraft, weather conditions, airports, and flight procedures. Pilots can use simulators to train for routine flights, practice emergency procedures, and improve their skills. Flight simulation is used extensively in pilot training programs for both civilian and military aviation. It offers a safe and cost-effective way to train pilots, allowing them to gain experience and proficiency before transitioning to actual aircraft.</p>

								<h2 id="content">...and why do they need better airports?</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><a href="images/amx.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/amx.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>Most flight simulation software out of the box only comes with "default" sceneries. What this means is a lot of the global scenery and airports are made using auto-generated data from OSM (Open Street Map), and terrain maps. While this provides quantity, it does not provide quality. There are over 20,000 airport in the world and providing personalized hand-made tailored airports for each is not possible. As such members that participate in flight simulation will oftentimes painstakingly produce their own airport sceneries in extremely high detail on their own. These can then either be provided to the community for free, or as payware.</p>

									<p>I am one of those passionate members of this community and have been making sceneries for flight simulation software since 2013 (I was 13 back then for reference). My earliest works were very rough and I have gained significant knowledge over the last 10 years, getting more than 15000 downloads on my airport sceneries, and have vastly improved my work. On this page, you will be able to check all my work and links to them, a rough outline as to what the procedure and learning curves are, and the end result of some of my best work. Hope you enjoy!</p>

								<h2 id="content" class="icon solid fa-plane-departure">&nbsp&nbspThe Old Way to Do It</h2>

										<p><span class="image left"><a href="images/ade.JPG" class="image"><img src="images/ade.JPG" alt="" /></a></span> Back in 2013 when I started modifying default airports for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, the software that could be used was severely limiting and the learning curve extremely steep. 2013 was a very young time for flight simulation on the internet and as such software to modify airports were limited to AFCAD editors (AFCAD here is essentially .bgl files and .xml files compiled into one Scenery-Texture folder structure which could then easily be pasted into the simulator's directory to install the new modified airport). The primary software used back then was called Airport Design Editor (ADE) which was made by ScruffyDuck, a developer who was pivotal in the revolution of scenery developing and SDKs back then. ADE was a simple GUI tool which enabled scenery developers like myself to modify default airports to a limit.</p>

										<p><span class="image right"><a href="images/sbx.JPG" class="image"><img src="images/sbx.JPG" alt="" /></a></span> As time went on and flight simulation software became more advanced, more tools became available. When Flight Simulator X gained mainstream popularity with growing computer specs, the sceneries started to become increasingly intensive and detailed. Learning all this new software through pure manual-reading and forum-searching was quite an experience. Some examples of tools available during FSX days are SBuilderX, which generated photorealistic scenery tiles of the earth to be placed in FSX. These photorealistic tiles finally matched exactly how the world looked in the real world, where the roads were exactly, where the rivers ran, and even where power lines passed through. Flight simulation was getting ever closer to reality. </p>

										<p><span class="image left"><a href="images/pek.png" class="image"><img src="images/pek.png" alt="" /></a></span> Soon enough, 3D modeling real world airport terminals, ATC towers, and buildings became the next big thing. The rise of Google Sketchup and Autodesk GMax enabled scenery developers like myself to learn 3D modeling from scratch and implement realistic airport buildings into these modified airports. As real as these buildings were, they did take up a significant amount of time to make from scratch and not to forget the texturing that went with these buildings. To learn texturing, one had to learn GIMP (Flight simulation software of ye olden times always used prehistoric image types like .bmp or old types of .dds which required GIMP to convert), and Adobe Photoshop if you really had to up the realism.</p>

									<span class="image center"><img src="images/vabb/vabb1.gif" alt="">

									<br>
									<br>
										<p><span class="image right"><a href="images/a333.png" class="image"><img src="images/a333.png" alt="" /></a></span>Then in 2017, a new type of physics based simulator came out. Developed by Laminar Research, X-Plane 11, instead of using lookup tables to determine how physics interacted with stuff around it, instead used real time physical nodes to determine how it interacted with everything. A revolution at that time, it quickly gained popularity and received widespread critical acclaim. It was very very popular amongst scenery developers for one big reason: The versatility and intelligence of its scenery developing SDK. Dubbed the World Editor (WED), this new piece of software changed the game for scenery developers everywhere. It was just a much, much improved software over tools like ADE. It enabled placing of real world photoreal tiles right into its software eliminating the need for an external software like SBuilderX for it.</p>

										<p><span class="image left"><a href="images/wed.png" class="image"><img src="images/wed.png" alt="" /></a></span> I will say that learning to use this GUI program was really really fun. It was a steep learning curve, but the enjoyment of seeing your work show up in a virtual world is immeasurable. I highly recommend it if you ever want to feel a high level of satisfaction. You could do everything from placing objects like cars and firetrucks, to making rivers and small culverts in the program. You could place your custom made terminals, real world photoreal tiles, add real world NAV details to the airports and more. All contained within one program. I could really stretch its legs when I worked on my largest project, Mumbai International Airport. It took me 1.5 years to do that from start to finish, so you could imagine how much effort and persistence went into it. You'll hear more about that later, but one more software introduction is due before we move on, and it's a big one.</p>

										<p><span class="image right"><a href="images/blend.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/blend.jpg" alt="" /></a></span> Blender is a well known and pivotal tool in any scenery developers toolkit in 2024. Blender is a powerful, open-source 3D creation suite that encompasses various aspects of 3D modeling, animation, rendering, rigging, simulation, and more. It's available for free and is maintained by a dedicated community of developers and artists. Flight Simulation scenery developing usually only needs 3D modeling, and texture manipulation, but a tool as powerful as Blender was never available 10 years ago for the flight simulation community, and its introduction into the world of scenery developing has been revolutionary. This along with FSDevelopers's ModelConverterX have been the two biggest tools that are used in 2024 for making custom airport terminals, ATC towers and buildings from scratch.  </p>
