											<h3>Aviation and Flight Simulation</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I've always been passionate about aviation, ever since I hopped on an Airbus A320 at a very young age. I have cultivated a deep interest in both real-world flying and flight simulation, as flight simulation is as close as you could get to the real thing. With a keen understanding of aviation principles and procedures, I immerse myself in the world of flight through hands-on experiences and virtual simulations.</p>
										<p>In the realm of flight simulation, I frequently use popular flight simulation software such as X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator to pass my time but at the same time learn more about flying, procedures, and the world. I recreate realistic flight scenarios, honing my piloting skills and expanding my knowledge of aircraft systems and operations. It's my favorite hobby.</p>

											<h3>Photography</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Seeing airplanes made me capture them, and this is how I got into the hobby of photography. I harness some of my creativity and technical skills to learn how Digital SLR cameras worked, and began to capture moments that resonated with me, or moments I wanted to treasure forever. visually and emotionally. Photography serves as a medium for storytelling and self-expression for me. Whether exploring landscapes, taking pictures of airplane wings, or documenting events, I continuously refine my craft and seek to evoke meaning through my photography.</p>

											<h3>Geography</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Another consequence of aviation as a hobby and flight simulation was that I was extremely interested in geography and countries around the world from the get go.Ever since I was a kid I've been captivated by the vastness and diversity of our world. It's not just about knowing where places are on a map; it's about delving into the stories, cultures, and colors that make each corner of the globe unique. This also evolved into me loving traveling as a side-effect, a love I still carry to this day.</p>
										<p>And yes, I can name all the countries in the world, and place every US State on the map with no borders!</p>

											<h3>Meteorology of Tropical Cyclones</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My fascination with meteorology of tropical cyclones began when I was studying at Florida Atlantic University in 2019, and that is when we had to evacuate for a potential hit from Hurricane Dorian, a potent Category-5 cyclone that ended up stalling over the Bahamas and causing untold misery and destruction. The sheer power of these tropical entities captivated me to no end, and I've been hooked on their genesis, path, strength and eventual demise ever since. </p>
										<p>Tracking tropical cyclones isn't just a hobby for meâ€”it's a passion that drives me to stay informed, analyze data, and anticipate the behavior of these formidable storms. From studying atmospheric conditions and oceanic patterns to monitoring satellite imagery and Doppler radar, I immerse myself in every aspect of tropical cyclone dynamics, seeking to unravel the mysteries of their formation, intensification, and movement. How much would windshear inhibit development? Would the subtropical high steer the cyclone more westward? Will Vortical Hot Towers signal a period of rapid intensification? I love to seek answers to all of these.</p>
										<p>Moreover, my passion extends beyond mere observation; it fuels a desire to educate and raise awareness about the importance of preparedness and resilience in vulnerable communities. Through outreach initiatives, social media engagement on Discord, I strive to disseminate accurate information, dispel myths, and empower individuals to make informed decisions in the face of impending tropical cyclones.</p>
										<p>Additionally, I actively contribute to online forums and discussions, exchanging insights with fellow meteorology enthusiasts and weather aficionados. Sharing observations, analysis, and forecasting techniques, I foster a collaborative environment where knowledge is freely shared and collective understanding is deepened.</p>
										<p>Pictured is one of my favorite tropical cyclones on visible satellite band-13, Hurricane Epsilon in 2020, a harmless hurricane that showed untold beauty and power in a very busy Atlantic Hurricane Season of 2020</p>

											<h3>Manga Translating and Typesetting</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This one might seem off-beat, but I've been a fan of specific types and genres of manga, and unfortunately found the english versions missing or lacking. I, then, took it upon myself to clean (the Japanese text off the dialouge boxes), translate the Japanese to English, and typeset (basically paste English text on the pages) myself, and eventually I have built a team on Discord that regularly cleans, translates, and typesets manga into English.  in the vibrant world of manga, I've discovered a passion for the intricate art of translation and typesetting. Beyond mere enjoyment of the stories and characters, I find immense fulfillment in bridging linguistic and cultural barriers, bringing beloved manga titles to a wider audience through accurate and engaging translations.</p>

											<h3>Gymming and Biking</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Embracing an active lifestyle, I have cultivated a passion for both gymming and biking, finding joy and fulfillment in the pursuit of physical fitness and outdoor adventure, even though I might end up sweaty at the end of it all.</p>
										<p>At the gym, I view each workout session as an opportunity for personal growth and muscular growth ;). Whether lifting weights, or engaging in cardio routines, I approach each session with dedication and determination, pushing my limits to achieve new milestones and overcome challenges. With a focus on proper form, technique, and consistency, I strive to build strength, endurance, and overall fitness, knowing that every drop of sweat brings me closer to my goals. This has also extended into my love for biking, but unfortunately I have not been able to do much of it lately due to the extreme heat around my area, but I hope to get back to it soon.</p>
